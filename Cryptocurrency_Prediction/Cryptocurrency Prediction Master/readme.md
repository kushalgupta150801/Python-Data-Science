## Inspiration
As Crypto is the future of the world and people are moving towards the crypto, so we are focused on bring some solutions or platform for the people to utilize their crypto in an efficient way. People can gather information and learn from our platform


## Learning
We have implemented the solution with the latest web3 stack and learnt a lot of things like creating blockchain contract and deploying it. CockroachDB is new to us and we have tried to built great from that and Circle CI is an awesome platform for deployment but we are not aware of that and it's very helpfull for us. and closing thought, in this application we have tried to implement best UI for the user 


## Challenges
As dealing with crypto is not handy for everyone and we are also one of them , we have faced a lot of issue in creating contracts.
CockrochDB is also a major challenge for us as it has some unmatching criteria from a SQL. 
Circle CI is also one of the challenge that we have faced as we are not aware of it.
After all that, thanks to the documentation provided, that helps a lot and now, we have the final build ready.
